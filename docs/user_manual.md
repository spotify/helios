# User Manual

This guide gives an overview of Helios, and what you need to know to deploy and run your Docker containers using it.

Note that this guide assumes that you are familiar with [Docker](http://docker.io) and concepts like images and containers. If you aren't familiar with Docker, see the [getting started page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/).

Basic Concepts in Helios
---

* **Job:** A job configuration tells Helios how to run your Docker container. It consists of things like a job name, a job version, the name of your Docker image, any environment variables you wish to pass to the running container, ports you wish to expose, and the command to run inside the container, if any.

* **Master:** Helios masters are the servers that the Helios CLI and other tools talk to. They coordinate the deployment of your Docker containers onto Helios agents.

* **Agents:** Helios agents, sometimes known as Helios hosts, are the machines on which the images you built eventually run. The masters tell agents to download jobs and run them.

Install the Helios CLI
---

Whichever environment you are deploying to, you should install the CLI locally so you can talk to 
Helios clusters without having to SSH to another machine.

  * Ubuntu Trusty: `dpkg -i helios_all.deb` [download from here](https://github.com/spotify/helios/releases)
  * Mac OS X: `brew install helios` (after installing [Spotify's homebrew tap](https://github.com/spotify/homebrew-public))

Using the Helios CLI
---

The `helios` command is your primary interface for interacting with the Helios cluster.

When using the CLI, you'll have to specify which Helios endpoint you want to talk to. To talk to a specific Helios master, use the `-z` flag. For example, if you have a Helios master running locally on the default port:

    $ helios -z http://localhost:5801

**Note:** The Helios client resolves hostnames into IP addresses and round-robins and retries among those IP addresses.

If you have multiple masters, you can [setup automatic master lookup](automatic_master_lookup.md).

**Note:** that the rest of this manual uses the `helios` command without specifying either the `-z` or `-d` flag. This is only for simplicity, though you can emulate this behavior by aliasing the `helios` command. For example:

    alias helios='helios -z http://localhost:5801'

This will save you from having to type the `-z` flag over and over again.

If you need general help, run `helios --help`. Many Helios CLI commands also take the `--json` option, which will produce JSON results instead of human-readable ones. This is useful if you want to script Helios or incorporate it into a build process.

## Managing Helios Agents

### Register and Unregister Agents

Register and unregister with `helios [un]register <hostname> <unqiue ID>`.

### List Agents

List agents with `helios hosts [optional hostname pattern]`. If your agents have labels like
`key=value` (see below on how to label agents), you can use host selector expressions like
`helios hosts -s key1=value1 -s key2!=value2 -s "key3 in (value3a, value3b)"`.
Hosts matching these expressions will be returned. Multiple conditions can be
specified, separated by spaces (as separate  arguments). If multiple conditions are given,
all must be fulfilled. Operators supported are =, !=, in and notin. See `helios hosts -h` for more
info.

### Label Agents

You can add labels to your agents when starting the Helios agent process by passing in
`java AgentMain ... --labels key1=value1 --labels key2=value2`. Labels are used by
[deployment groups](#using-deployment-groups).

Creating Your Job
---
Once you have a Docker image you want to deploy, you need to tell Helios how you want it run. First we tell Helios the relevant details.

### A basic job

If you specified an `ENTRYPOINT` in the `Dockerfile` you built your image with, you can create your job with the `create` command. For example, to create a job named "foo" to run the `nginx` image:

    $ helios create foo:v1 nginx
    Creating job: {"id":"foo:v1:2a89d5a87851d68678aabdad38d31faa296f5bf1","image":"nginx","command":[],"env":{},"ports":{},"registration":{}}
    Done.
    foo:v1:2a89d5a87851d68678aabdad38d31faa296f5bf1

### Specifying a command to run

If you didn't specify an `ENTRYPOINT` in your Dockerfile, you can specify a command to run when the container is started. For example, to create a Ubuntu container that prints the time every 60 seconds:

    $ helios create testjob:1 ubuntu:12.04 -- \
        /bin/sh -c 'while true; do date; sleep 60; done'
    Creating job: {"command":["/bin/sh","-c","while true; do date; sleep 60;        
    done"],"env":{},"expires":null,"id":"testjob:1:4f7125bff35d3cecaac237da3ab17efca8a765f9",
    "image":"ubuntu:12.04","ports":{},"registration":{},"registrationDomain":"","volumes":{}}
    Done.
    testjob:1:da2fa2d26da6a8392536826631e58803e3fcc911

**NOTE**: When passing a command-line to your container, precede it with the double dash (`--`) as in the above example. While it might work sometimes without it, I wouldn't count on it, as the Helios CLI may misinterpret your intent.

### Passing environment variables

For some use cases, you may want to pass some environment variables to the job that aren't baked into the image. In which case you can do:

    $ helios create testjob:1 ubuntu:12.04 --env FOO=bar -- \
        /bin/sh -c 'while true; do echo $FOO; date; sleep 60; done'
    Creating job: {"id":"testjob:1:bad9111c6c9e10975408f2f41c561fd3849f55
    61","image":"ubuntu:12.04","command":["/bin/sh","-c","while true; do echo $FOO; date; sleep 60;
    done"],"env":{"FOO":"bar"}}
    Done.
    testjob:1:4f7125bff35d3cecaac237da3ab17efca8a765f9

The last line of output in the command output is the canonical job ID. Most times, you will only need the `jobName:jobVersion` parts, but in the event that you create two jobs with the same name and version, you can unambiguously choose which one you intend to operate on by supplying the full ID.

### Using a Helios job config file

`helios create -d <DOMAINS> -f <HELIOS_JOB_CONFIG_FILE_PATH> <MORE> <CLI> <ARGS>` will merge
job parameters in the file `<HELIOS_JOB_CONFIG_FILE_PATH>` with other command line arguments. CLI
args take precedence. The job configuration file should be valid JSON with a schema that matches the
output of `helios inspect -d <DOMAINS> <EXISTING_JOB_NAME> --json`. See the next section for an
example that uses all the available configuration keys with an explanation of each one.

### All Helios Job Options

```json

  }
}
```

All fields are optional except for `id` and `image`. Generally, you won't specify
the `id` and `image` of a job directly in a job config file. Instead, those will
be passed in via the CLI.

Note that the recommended best practice is to save all your job creation
parameters in version-controlled files in your project directory. This allows
you to tie your Helios job params to changes in your application code.

#### addCapabilities
The Linux capabilities to add to the container. Optional. See [Docker docs][1].

#### dropCapabilities
The Linux capabilities to remove from the container. Optional. See [Docker docs][1].

#### command
The command(s) to pass to the container. Optional.

#### env
Environment variables. Optional.

#### expires
An ISO-8601 string representing the date/time when this job should expire. The
job will be undeployed from all hosts and removed at this time. 

Example value: `2014-06-01T12:00:00Z`

Optional, if not specified the job does not expire.

#### gracePeriod
If is specified, Helios will unregister from service discovery and wait the
specified number of seconds before undeploying. Optional, defaults to `0` for
no grace period.

#### healthCheck
A health check Helios will execute on the container. See the health checks
section below. Optional.

#### id
The id of the job. Required.

#### image
The docker image to use. Required.

#### hostname
The hostname to be passed to the container. Optional.

#### metadata
Arbitrary key-value pairs that can be stored with the Job. Optional.

The Helios service does not act on these metadata labels, but will store them
and return them in any request to view/inspect the job.

If the environment variable `GIT_COMMIT` is set, the helios CLI command
`helios create` will set a metadata field for `"GIT_COMMIT": <the value>`.

#### networkMode
Sets the networking mode for the container. 

Supported values are: 
  - `bridge`
  - `host`
  - `container:<name|id>`. 
  
For further reference see [Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/reference/run/#network-settings).

#### ports
Specifies how ports inside the container should be mapped/published to the host
the container runs on. Port mappings are optional, by default nothing is mapped
to the host.

Specify an endpoint name and a single port (e.g.  `{"http": {"internalPort":
8080}}`) for dynamic port mapping (i.e. Docker chooses the external port).

For static port mapping, specify the internal and external ports like `{"http":
{"internalPort": 8080, "externalPort": 80}}`.
  
For example, `{"foo": {"internalPort": 4711}}`  will  map the internal port
4711 of the container to an arbitrary external port on the host. 
  
Specifying `{"foo": {"internalPort": 4711, "externalPort": 80}}` will map
internal port 4711  of the container to port 80 on the host.

The `ip` attribute is optional and specifies the IP address on which the port
will be exposed. Although Helios will check the IP string is a valid IP address,
it won't verify the address is routable or whether it'll work at deploy-time.

The protocol will be TCP by default. For UDP, add `"protocol": udp`, for
example `{"quic": {"internalPort": 80, "protocol": "udp"}}` or
`{"dns": {"internalPort": 53, "externalPort": 53, "protocol": "udp"}}`. 

The name of the endpoint specified in the port mapping will be used if
specifying service registration using the `registration` below.

#### ramdisks
Memory-backed (tmpfs) mounts that are created and mounted when the container is run. Optional.

Format:
```
"ramdisks": {
  "<mount-point>": "<mount-options>",
  ...
}
```

The mount point is the path where the ramdisk will be mounted in the container.
The mount point must be an absolute path.

Example:
```
"ramdisks": {
  "/tmp": "rw,size=32m",
  "/run": "rw,noexec,nosuid,size=65535k"
}
```

#### registration
Service discovery registration. Optional, by default no ports/services are
registered. 

Specify a service name, the port name and a protocol in the format
`service/protocol=port`. 

For example `{"website/tcp": {"ports": {"http": {}}}}` will register a service
named `website` with the port named `http` (referring to the `ports` section)
with the protocol `tcp`.

Protocol is optional and defaults as `tcp`. If there is only one port mapping,
this will be used by default and it will be enough to specify only the service
name, e.g. `{"wordpress": {}}`.

#### registrationDomain
If set, overrides the default domain in which discovery service registration
occurs. Optional.

#### resources
Sets the runtime constraints for a container. Available keys are "memory" (,
"memorySwap", "cpuset", and "cpuShares".
* "memory": a positive integer limiting the number of bytes of memory
* "memorySwap": a positive integer limiting the number of bytes of total memory (memory + swap)
* "cpuset": CPUs in which to allow execution, e.g. 0-3
* "cpuShares": CPU shares (relative weight, defaults to 1024)

These settings correspond to the ones in the [Docker docs][2].

What is allowed here will vary based upon the discovery service plugin used.

#### rolloutOptions
When you run `helios rolling-update`, the rolling-update options will be constructed from the
values you provide on the CLI and the job configuration (see above JSON for an example of a full job
 config) with the following precedence:

* Parameters included in the API request (eg, flags passed on the command line)
* Parameters defined in the job configuration (of the job being rolled out)
* The default value for the parameter as defined in the RolloutOptions class

Example:

`helios rolling-update --overlap --parallelism=3`

with a job config containing

```
"rolloutOptions": {
  "parallelism": 2,
  "overlap": false,
  "ignoreFailures": false
}
```

Will ultimately have these options at `rolling-update` time.

```
"rolloutOptions": {
  "migrate": false,
  "parallelism": 3,
  "timeout": 300,
  "overlap": true,
  "token": "",
  "ignoreFailures": false
}
```

Since timeout, migrate, and token weren't specified either via CLI or job config, they get their
values from the defaults in [`RolloutOptions`][rollout-options-code].

#### secondsToWaitBeforeKill
Optional. When a job is being stopped or undeployed, the helios-agent will ask
Docker to stop the container (which sends SIGTERM) and pass along a value for
how many seconds to wait for the container to shutdown before resorting to
killing the container (with SIGKILL). If not specified, defaults to 120
seconds.

If the container requires a long time to shut itself down gracefully, this
value should be specified to prevent Docker from killing your container/process
before that period of time has passed. In most cases this option likely does
not need to be specified.

#### securityOpt
Optional. A list of strings denoting security options for running Docker
containers, e.g. `docker run --security-opt <value...>`.

For more details, see the [Docker
docs](https://docs.docker.com/reference/run/#security-configuration).

#### token
Insecure access token meant to prevent accidental changes to your job (e.g.
undeploys). Optional.

If specified, the token value must be used in all interactions with the Helios
CLI when managing instances of the job, for example when undeploying a running
container.

#### volumes
Container volumes. Optional. 

Specify a single path to create a data volume, a container path and a source
path to mount a directory from the host, or a container path and a name to mount
a named volume. The named volume will be created by docker if it does not exist;
see [volumes][] in the Docker reference for full details. The container path can
be suffixed with "rw" or "ro" to create a read-write or read-only volume mount,
respectively.

Format: `"[container-path]:[rw|ro]": "[host-path|volume-name]"`.

Examples:

  * Mount a new data volume (name assigned by docker) to `/foo` in the container: `"volumes": {"/foo": ""}`
  * Mount `/src` from the host to `/dst` in the container: `"volumes": {"/dst": "/src"}`
  * Mount a volume named `my-vol` to `/dst` in the container: `"volumes": {"/dst": "my-vol"}`

[volumes]: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#volume-shared-filesystems

### Health Checks

When a job is started, Helios can optionally run a health check before registering your service with
service discovery. This prevents the service from receiving traffic before it is ready. After the
container starts, Helios will execute the health check as follows.

* Begin executing health checks and mark the job as "HEALTHCHECKING".
* Start with a 1 second interval, then back off exponentially until reaching a maximum interval of 30 seconds.
* If a health check succeeds
  * Stop running health checks
  * Register service with service discovery (if job is configured to do so)
  * Mark the job as "RUNNING"
* If a health check doesn't succeed, Helios will leave the job in the "HEALTHCHECKING" state forever
  for debugging purposes.

#### HTTP
This health check makes an HTTP request to the specified port and path and considers a return
code of 2xx or 3xx as successful. HTTP health checks are specified in the form `port_name:path`,
where `port_name` is the **name** of the exposed port (as set in the `--port` argument), and `path`
is the path portion of the URL. Requests have a connect timeout of 500ms and a read timeout of 10s.

To specify a HTTP healthcheck in the CLI arguments:

```bash
$ helios create --http-check http:/healthcheck -p http=8080 ...
```

or instead to specify the healthcheck in your Helios job config file:

```json
"healthCheck" : {
  "type" : "http",
  "path" : "/healthcheck",
  "port" : "http-admin"
}
```

#### TCP
This health check succeeds if it is able to connect to the specified port. You must specify the
**name** of the port as set in the `--port` argument. Each request will timeout after 500ms.

To specify a TCP healthcheck in the CLI arguments:

```bash
$ helios create --tcp-check http-admin -p http-admin=4229 ...
```

or instead to specify the healthcheck in your Helios job config file:

```json
"healthCheck" : {
  "type" : "tcp",
  "port" : "http-admin"
}
```

#### Exec

This health check runs `docker exec` with the provided command. The service will not be registered
in service discovery until the command executes successfully in the container, i.e. exits with
status code 0.

```bash
$ helios create --exec-check "ping google.com" ...
```

or instead to specify the healthcheck in your Helios job config file:

```json
"healthCheck" : {
  "type" : "exec",
  "command" : ["ping", "google.com"]
},
```

### Specifying an Access Token

You can optionally specify an access token when creating a job by using the `--token` parameter.

    $ helios create --token abc123 foo:v1 nginx

You now need to specify the token for each deploy, undeploy, start, stop and remove operation on
that job using `--token` parameter. If no token or an incorrect one is specified, those operations
will fail with a `FORBIDDEN` status code.

**Note:** This token is intended only to prevent unintentional operations. The token mechanism does
not provide actual security, and will not prevent malicious behavior.

Deploying Your Job
---
Now that you've created a Helios job, you can deploy it to Helios hosts. You'll need to find a running Helios host to do so. You can see which hosts are available using the CLI. For example:

    $ helios hosts
    HOST           STATUS         DEPLOYED  RUNNING  CPUS  MEM   LOAD AVG  MEM USAGE  OS                      VERSION  DOCKER
    192.168.33.10. Up 29 minutes  0         0        4     1 gb  0.00      0.39       Linux3.15.3-tinycore64  0.0.33   1.1.2 (1.13)

In the this example, there's a single agent named `192.168.33.10`, so we'll deploy our job there. To deploy the job we can just run:

    $ helios deploy testjob:1 192.168.33.10
    Deploying testjob:1:4f7125bff35d3cecaac237da3ab17efca8a765f9|START on [192.168.33.10]
    192.168.33.10: done

While we only have one host listed here in the `deploy` command, you can specify multiple. While the number of times this will fail should be exceptionally low, the more hosts listed, the higher the probability of failure. But since the operation is idempotent, you can just re-execute it until it succeeds for all hosts. The hosts where the job is already deployed will respond with an error saying `JOB_ALREADY_DEPLOYED`, but that won't prevent the others from being deployed to.

You can deploy more than one job on a host, so deploying another job on the same host will not undeploy the existing one.

### Checking deployment status and history

Now we'd like to see if everything went according to plan:

    $ helios jobs testjob:1
    JOB ID               NAME       VERSION    HOSTS    COMMAND                                             ENVIRONMENT
    testjob:1:4f7125b    testjob    1          1        /bin/sh -c "while true; do date; sleep 60; done"    FOO=bar

    Now we can also see what the history of the job is across all agents if we chose by running:

    $ helios history testjob:1
    AGENT            TIMESTAMP                  STATE       THROTTLED    CONTAINERID
    192.168.33.10    2014-08-11 14:37:44.987    CREATING    NO           <none>
    192.168.33.10    2014-08-11 14:37:45.202    STARTING    NO           60671498ae98
    192.168.33.10    2014-08-11 14:37:45.387    RUNNING     NO           60671498ae98

### Undeploying

We can stop our job by undeploying it:

    $ helios undeploy testjob:1 192.168.33.10
    Undeploying testjob:1:4f7125bff35d3cecaac237da3ab17efca8a765f9 from [192.168.33.10]
    192.168.33.10: done

If we view the history again, it should show something like this:

    $ helios history testjob:1
    AGENT            TIMESTAMP                  STATE       THROTTLED    CONTAINERID
    192.168.33.10    2014-08-11 14:37:44.987    CREATING    NO           <none>
    192.168.33.10    2014-08-11 14:37:45.202    STARTING    NO           60671498ae98
    192.168.33.10    2014-08-11 14:37:45.387    RUNNING     NO           60671498ae98
    192.168.33.10    2014-08-11 14:42:14.403    STOPPED     NO           60671498ae98

We can see that the job stopped. Additionally, checking job status will show again, that the job is stopped.

### Using Deployment Groups

You can manage your deployments at a higher level with deployment groups. A deployment group
determines the list and sequence of hosts to deploy, undeploys prior jobs it has deployed, and
deploys the specified job.

    $ helios create-deployment-group <group name> <label1 key1=value1> <label2 key2=value2>
    $ helios rolling-update <job ID> <group name>
    $ helios deployment-group-status <group name>

[Here's more information](https://github.com/spotify/helios/blob/master/docs/deployment_groups.md)
on how to use deployment groups and their motivation.

Once Inside The Container
---

Now once you are inside your container, if you have exposed ports,
you'll find a few environment variables set that you may need.  If you
have a port named `foo`, there will be an environment variable named
`HELIOS_PORT_foo` set to the host and port of the port named `foo` as
it is seen *from outside the container*.  So if you had `-p foo=2121`
in your job creation commmand, once deployed on a host named
`foo.example.com`, from inside the container you would see
