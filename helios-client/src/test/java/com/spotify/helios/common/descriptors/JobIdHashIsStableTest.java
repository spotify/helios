/**
 * Verifies that the computed hash of a Job stays the same even if we add new fields to the Job.
 *
 * <p>A helios client (the CLI, a user of TemporaryJobs, etc) will construct a Job, compute it's
 * hash, and send them to the server as JSON. The server will compute the same hash of all of the
 * Job's fields and check that the hash matches.</p>
 *
 * <p>Whenever we update the server-side code, we can't be sure that all of the clients are at the
 * same version. In fact we want to avoid any changes that would require the server and (every
 * single) client to be at the same version. Therefore we have to be careful whenever adding new
 * fields to the Job (or new fields to its fields) that we do not change the computed hash that a
 * newer server would compute for a Job-and-hash sent by an older client.</p>
 *
 * <p>What this means in practice is that we cannot add new fields or sub-fields to the Job class
 * and assign default non-null or non-empty values to them within their class or declaration.
 * The JSON serialization used by the Job class when computing <code>hash = sha1(json(job))</code>
 * will not include any empty (null or empty collections) in the resulting JSON string.</p>
 *
 * <p>This test verifies that static Job instances retain the same computed hash from this point
 * forward.</p>
